Machine Learning-based project to predict whether an asteroid is potentially hazardous using NASA dataset.
# Hazardous Asteroid Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting whether an asteroid is potentially hazardous based on data provided by NASA's Near Earth Object (NEO) dataset. By leveraging machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), we aim to improve asteroid risk classification for planetary defense.

## Objectives

- Analyze key features affecting asteroid hazard classification.
- Compare multiple ML algorithms and evaluate performance.
- Deploy the best model for real-time or batch asteroid classification.

## Dataset

The dataset is sourced from [NASA's Near Earth Object Web Service (NeoWs)](https://api.nasa.gov/). It includes physical parameters of asteroids like:
- Estimated diameter
- Relative velocity
- Miss distance
- Absolute magnitude

## Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest (Best Accuracy)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Results

Random Forest achieved the highest classification accuracy and robustness among all models.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, jupyter
